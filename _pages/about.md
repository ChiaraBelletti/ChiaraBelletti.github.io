Welcome to my webpage!

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at Institute for Strategy, Technology and Organization (<a href="https://www.som.lmu.de/isto/en/">ISTO</a>) at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München (<a href="https://www.lmu.de/en/">LMU Munich</a>). 

I conduct empirical research on digital platforms, focusing on both two-sided markets and community-based platforms. My work examines user behavior and the strategic decisions of intermediaries (mostly incentives schemes and platforms integration).
I am particularly interested in industries such as online labor markets, short-term rentals, and music streaming.
