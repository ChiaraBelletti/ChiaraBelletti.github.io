Welcome to my webpage!

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the <a href="https://chairgovreg.fondation-dauphine.fr/">Governance and Regulation Chair</a> at the Université Paris Dauphine-PSL (<a href="https://dauphine.psl.eu/">University Paris Dauphine - PSL</a>). 

I conduct empirical research on digital platforms, focusing on both two-sided markets and community-based platforms. My work examines user behavior and the strategic decisions of intermediaries (mostly incentives schemes and platforms integration).
I am particularly interested in industries such as online labor markets, short-term rentals, and music streaming.
