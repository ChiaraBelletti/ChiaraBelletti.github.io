Welcome to my webpage!

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the <a href="https://chairgovreg.fondation-dauphine.fr/">Governance and Regulation Chair</a> at the Université Paris Dauphine-PSL (<a href="https://dauphine.psl.eu/">University Paris Dauphine - PSL</a>). 

My research focuses on the empirical analysis of digital platforms. I am particularly interested in user behavior in two-sided markets and the impact of platform governance measures on the user journey.

Industries I study include online labor markets, short-term rentals, car-pooling and music streaming.

From January 2025, I am the Scientific Coordinator for the Governance and Regulation Chair's research project BlablaModes (in collaboration with BlaBlaCar and supported by ADEME).
