  * Abstract: Do rating systems provide incentives to sellers when they are about to exit a market? Using data from Airbnb, this paper examines how end-of-game considerations affect hosts’ effort decisions. We take advantage of a regulation on short-term rentals in the City of Los Angeles to identify hosts who anticipated their imminent exit from the platform due to non-compliance with new eligibility rules. We focus on hosts who left the platform as a result of the regulation and measure their effort with listing’s ratings in effort-related categories such as check-in, communication, and cleanliness.
Using a Difference-in-Differences and Event Study approach, we compare how effort-related ratings changed—relative to location ratings—after the regulation was announced and during its implementation. Our analysis documents a statistically significant decrease in effort in the last periods of the hosts’ activity. These findings provide insights for platform managers, emphasizing how end-of-game considerations can undermine the effectiveness of rating systems in incentivizing high-quality service provision.
